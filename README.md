# Fifth Winter School of Computational Chemistry

Welcome to the official repository of the **Fifth Winter School of Computational Chemistry**. This repository provides essential resources, including installation guides, lecture materials, ORCA job files, Python Jupyter Notebooks, and theoretical exercise documents to support participants in setting up and running computational chemistry simulations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Guide Directory** – Contains the installation manual and test scripts to verify ORCA, Python, and Jupyter.
- **Lectures Documentation** – Includes winter school lecture materials and valuable resources from previous winter schools of computational chemistry.
- **Computational Exercises** – Directory for ORCA jobs and interactive Python notebooks related to computational exercises at the school.
- **Theoretical Exercises** – Theoretical exercises directory.

The directory names are self-explanatory, and each contains the necessary documentation to guide users
